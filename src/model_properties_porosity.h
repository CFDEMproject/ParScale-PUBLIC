	This code is designed to simulate transport processes (e.g., for heat and
	mass) within porous and no-porous particles, eventually undergoing
	chemical reactions.

	Parts of the code were developed in the frame of the NanoSim project funded
	by the European Commission through FP7 Grant agreement no. 604656.

Description
	This class is the base class for the particle's porosity and associated
	quantities (e.g., specific surface area).
