    This code is designed to simulate transport processes (e.g., for heat and
    mass) within porous and no-porous particles, eventually undergoing
    chemical reactions.

    Parts of the code were developed in the frame of the NanoSim project funded
    by the European Commission through FP7 Grant agreement no. 604656.
