Input File
======================

ParScale is built on the philosophy of a combination of `in.files` and properties that are specified for every equation the user wants to solve. Every `in.file` has the same structure:

- Mesh 
- Particle Number
- Coupling Model
- Equations
- Chemistry 
- Equation properties
- Control Command

All these user input is necessary to perform a simulation using ParScale. Some options (e.g. Chemistry) can be let out which is described in detail in the related .md document.
A complete `in.file` may look like:
