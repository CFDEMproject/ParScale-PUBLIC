1D swelling particle 
=======================================================

This simple example case demonstrates the swelling particle model for a single particle. All relevant parameters can be found in `chemistry_single_reaction.json` (`GrowthActive`, `growthMolesFormed`, `growthProductMolarWeight`, `growthProductDensity`)


How to run:
-----------

- Open a terminal at the `in.file_*`Â´s postion and just type `./Allrun_convective/dirchlet`
- In case `Allrun_*` and `Allclean` are not executable type `chmod +x All*`
- After the simulation is done type `Allclean` to delete all generated files
