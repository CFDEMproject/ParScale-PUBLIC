Reacting Non-Isothermal Solid Particle
=======================================================

This example case demonstrates the use of multiple 1D continuum
model equations that are fully coupled

How to run:
-----------

- Open a terminal at the `in.file_*`Â´s postion and just type `./Allrun_convective`
- In case `Allrun_*` and `Allclean` are not executable, just type `chmod +x All*`
- After the simulation is done type `Allclean` to delete all generated files
- The script `plotMe.m` is an input script for octave
